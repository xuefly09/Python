It can be useful, also it can be dangerous. The key point of this kind of pivotal searching is that the data is accessable everywhere whenever you need them. This is super attractive because it creates possibility of approaching information you desperately want in a specific spot - if only you are able to access the internet. Medium is not a problem - cellphone, i-watch, laptop and etc. However, the question is where your data will be stored. Or the more directly question is, is your data safe?

It is not so hard to imagine how useful this techonology is, as a cs student, through reading the article I can know that this kind of searching is like taking snapshoot in some programes, which will store some useful objects or classes in future use. Also, these snapshoots are really really private, no one other than the developer can reach them. Here comes the uncertainty - are you the only one who can reach these data? Is cloud safe enough for you to put quite privital information in it? I think if this question can't be solved, it is not a good idea to use pivotal searching.
