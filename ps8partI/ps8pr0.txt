From a big prospect, a real AI must be a evolving program. I think if as time is being consumed, sooner or later, we can get a AI when our algorithms are really complex enough to handle all human-like thinking. However, if it is not a evolving program, perhaps we still can't fully call it AI.

Come back to the reality, for a company, the differences between developing a evolving program and a specific-task aimed program are quite obvious. The former is more expensive, reusable and complicated when the later one is cheaper, low rate of reusing and more stable (simple). The question of how to make the choice is hard to answer. It is up to myriad elements. However, persoanlly, I prefer to the later one, which is the evolving program. Because I think, that's more like us - human. Our brain has been developed to treat specific task with a "evolving system." We don't have a particular part of the brain to do "open the computer!"
